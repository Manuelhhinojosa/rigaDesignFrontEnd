# 🛒 Design store E-Commerce Front-End

This is the front-end of a custom-built e-commerce web application designed for a real client. It serves as a modern online storefront built using React, Redux, and SASS, with Stripe integration for secure payments.

## 🧾 About the Project

This is the client-side of the e-commerce platform. It includes:

- A responsive, mobile-friendly shopping experience
- Dynamic cart functionality
- Stripe integration for secure checkout
- Toast notifications for smooth user feedback
- Media hosting with Cloudinary (images and video)
- Clean, intuitive UI tailored to the client’s brand

The app is currently deployed for showcase purposes only.  
We're still collaborating on adjustments and improvements, and the connected API is being developed in parallel — also built by me.

## ⚙️ Technologies & Libraries Used

- React.js (with React Router v6)
- Redux for global state management
- Stripe API for payment processing
- Cloudinary for media storage
- react-toastify for notifications
- SASS for styling
- EmailJS for form submissions

## 🔧 Backend API

The backend REST API is under development and fully built by me. It handles product storage, orders, and form submissions.
